                           Python is a general purpose, dynamic, high-level, and interpreted programming language. It supports Object Oriented programming approach to develop applications. It is simple and easy to learn and provides lots of high-level data structures.
                      </p>
                
                      <p>
                           Python is easy to learn yet powerful and versatile scripting language, which makes it attractive for Application Development.

                           Python's syntax and dynamic typing with its interpreted nature make it an ideal language for scripting and rapid application development.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                           Python supports multiple programming pattern, including object-oriented, imperative, and functional or procedural programming styles.Python is not intended to work in a particular area, such as web programming. That is why it is known as multipurpose programming language because it can be used with web, enterprise, 3D CAD, etc.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                           We don't need to use data types to declare variable because it is dynamically typed so we can write a=10 to assign an integer value in an integer variable.
                           Python makes the development and debugging fast because there is no compilation step included in Python development, and edit-test-debug cycle is very fast.

                      <p>Python was invented by <em>Guido van Rossum </em>in 1991 at CWI in Netherland. The idea of Python programming language has taken from the ABC programming language or we can say that ABC is a predecessor of Python language.</p>
                      <p>
                           There is also a fact behind the choosing name Python. Guido van Rossum was a fan of the popular BBC comedy show of that time, <em>"Monty Python's Flying Circus"</em>. So he decided to pick the name Python for his newly created programming language.

                           There is no use of curly braces or semicolon in Python programming language. It is English-like language. But Python uses the indentation to define a block of code. Indentation is nothing but adding whitespace before the statement when it is needed. For example:
                      <code
                        >def func():  
                        statement 1  
                        statement 2  
                        …………………  
                        …………………  
                          statement N  
                      </code>
                
                      In the above example, the statements that are same level to right belong to the function. Generally, we can use four whitespaces to define indentation.

                           Unlike the other programming languages, Python provides the facility to execute the code using few lines. For example - Suppose we want to print the "Hello World" program in Java; it will take three lines to print it.
                    </p>
                    <code
                        >public class HelloWorld {  
                           public static void main(String[] args){  
                          // Prints "Hello, World" to the terminal window.  
                            System.out.println("Hello World");  
                           }  
                           }    
                      </code>
                      On the other hand, we can do this using one statement in Python.
                      <code
                      >print("Hello World")  
                    </code>
                    Both programs will print the same result, but it takes only one statement without using a semicolon or curly braces in Python.

                    <article>
                           Variable is a name that is used to refer to memory location. Python variable is also known as an identifier and used to hold value.

                           In Python, we don't need to specify the type of variable because Python is a infer language and smart enough to get variable type.
                           
                           Variable names can be a group of both the letters and digits, but they have to begin with a letter or an underscore.
                           
                           It is recommended to use lowercase letters for the variable name. Rahul and rahul both are two different variables.
                      <p>
                        With the keyword var. For example, <code>a = 50 .</code> This syntax
                        can be used to declare both local and global variables.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                           In Python, every created object identifies uniquely in Python. Python provides the guaranteed that no two objects will have the same identifier. The built-in id() function, is used to identify the object identifier. Consider the following example. <code>a = 50  
                           b = a  
                           print(id(a))  
                           print(id(b))  
                           # Reassigned variable a  
                           a = 500  
                           print(id(a)) .</code> We assigned the b = a, a and b both point to the same object. When we checked by the id() function it returned the same number. We reassign a to 500; then it referred to the new object identifier.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                           We have already discussed how to declare the valid variable. Variable names can be any length can have uppercase, lowercase (A to Z, a to z), the digit (0-9), and underscore character(_). Consider the following example of valid variables names.<code> name = "Devansh"  
                                    age = 20  
                                    marks = 80.50  
                                      
                                    print(name)  
                                    print(age)  
                                    print(marks)  
                                    </code> 
                      </p>

                      <p>Variables can hold values, and every value has a data-type. Python is a dynamically typed language; hence we do not need to define the type of the variable while declaring it. The interpreter implicitly binds the value with its type.<code>a = 5  </code>The variable a holds integer value five and we did not define its type. Python interpreter will automatically interpret variables a as an integer type.

                           Python enables us to check the type of the variable used in the program. Python provides us the type() function, which returns the type of the variable passed.</p>
                  <p>Example:<code>
                           a=10  
b="Hi Python"  
c = 10.5  
print(type(a))  
print(type(b))  
print(type(c))  
                  </code></p>

                           Decision making is the most important aspect of almost all the programming languages. As the name implies, decision making allows us to run a particular block of code for a particular decision. Here, the decisions are made on the validity of the particular conditions. Condition checking is the backbone of decision making.<br>
                           The if statement is used to test a particular condition and if the condition is true, it executes a block of code known as if-block. The condition of if statement can be any valid logical expression which can be either evaluated to true or false.
                
                      <code>num = int(input("enter the number?"))  
                           if num%2 == 0:  
                               print("Number is even") </code>
                               Program to print the largest of the three numbers.
                      <code
                        >a = int(input("Enter a? "));  
                        b = int(input("Enter b? "));  
                        c = int(input("Enter c? "));

                           Functions are the most important aspect of an application. A function can be defined as the organized block of reusable code, which can be called whenever required.

                           Python allows us to divide a large program into the basic building blocks known as a function. The function contains the set of programming statements enclosed by {}. A function can be called multiple times to provide reusability and modularity to the Python program.
                           
                           The Function helps to programmer to break the program into the smaller part. It organizes the code very effectively and avoids the repetition of the code. As the program grows, function makes the program more organized.
                           
                           Python provide us various inbuilt functions like range() or print(). Although, the user can create its functions, which can be called user-defined functions.<br>
                           There are mainly two types of functions.
                      <ul>
                        <li><b>User-define functions</b> - The user-defined functions are those define by the user to perform the specific task.</li>
                        <li>
                           <b>Built-in functions</b> - The built-in functions are those functions that are pre-defined in Python.
                           In this tutorial, we will discuss the user define functions.
                        </li>
                        
                      </ul>
                      <p>
                           <h4>Function Calling</h4>
                           In Python, after the function is created, we can call it from another function. A function must be defined before the function call; otherwise, the Python interpreter gives an error. To call the function, use the function name followed by the parentheses.
                           
                           Consider the following example of a simple example that prints the message "Hello World".
                      </p>
                
                      <code>#function definition  
                           def hello_world():    
                               print("hello world")    
                           # function calling  
                           hello_world()   </code>
                      <p>
                           <h4>The return statement</h4>
                           The return statement is used at the end of the function and returns the result of the function. It terminates the function execution and transfers the result where the function is called. The return statement cannot be used outside of the function.
                      </p>
                      <code># Defining function  
                           def sum():  
                               a = 10  
                               b = 20  
                               c = a+b  
                               return c  
                           # calling sum() function in print statement  
                           print("The sum is:",sum())  </code>
